        <h2>What is Predictive Microbiology?</h2>
        <h3>The history of predictive microbiology</h3>
        <p>In 1937 Scott studied the rate of growth of microorganisms at different temperatures on beef, paying close attention to the rates of growth at the sides and edges where the meat would cool the most quickly. He also studied the role of moisture
            and CO2 concentration in the meat and surroundings, enabling the earliest shipments of non-frozen meat around the world. In the 1960s and ’70s, further studies on the role of temperature in microbial growth on various food products were performed,
            and a universal spoilage curve was developed as an early predictive model. In the 1980s widespread reports of various food poisonings reinvigorated interest in the use of predictive microbiology as a tool for food safety, with botulism, Salmonella,
            and Listeria monocytogenes posing a serious threat to consumers.

            A philosophy team from Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB) and the University of Antwerp analyzed the role self-deception plays in everyday life and the strategies people use to deceive themselves. In the journal Philosophical Psychology, Dr. Francesco Marchi and Professor Albert Newen describe four strategies used to stabilize and shield the positive self-image. According to their theory, self-deception helps people to stay motivated in difficult situations. The article was published on 6 January 2022
            The researchers call this strategy of self-deception the reorganization of beliefs. In their article, they describe three more frequently used strategies that come into play even earlier in order to prevent unpleasant facts from getting to you in the first place.

This includes selecting facts through purposeful action: people avoid places or persons that might bring problematic facts to their attention, such as the parent-teacher conference. Another strategy is to reject facts by casting doubt on the credibility of the source. As long as the father hears about his son's academic problems only indirectly and does not see the grades, he can ignore the problems. The last strategy is what Newen and Marchi call generating facts from an ambiguous state of affairs: "For instance, if the kind mathematics teacher gently suggests that the son is not coping, and the father would have expected a clear statement in case of difficulties, he may interpret the considerable kindness and the gentle description as a
            positive assessment of his son
            's abilities," Francesco Marchi elaborates on the example.
